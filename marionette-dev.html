      <div class="w-layout-hflex flex-block-16">
        <p class="sub-title"><strong>How it started</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph-5">It was my first project in a UX designer role. Before this, I worked and developed in the digital marketing field, but when war came to my country (24 Feb 2022), I lost all my projects.<br><br>So, I decided to move into design because I had considered this before and also already had some related skills from marketing, such as graphic design, ux-foundations, audience interaction, data analysis etc.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="w-layout-hflex flex-block-16">
        <p class="sub-title"><strong>First Problem</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph-5">Initially, stakeholders provided a brief overview of the project, and I was eager to start. Unfortunately, this eagerness led me to begin updating the existing low-fidelity wireframes without fully understanding the project scope. This approach proved to be a mistake, as I soon found myself inundated with numerous edits that did little to help me progress. It seemed I was stuck at the beginning.<br>‍<br>Realizing the need for a better foundation, I decided to conduct thorough research. I gathered input information, which improved my understanding of the project and the relevant field.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="w-layout-hflex flex-block-16">
        <p class="sub-title"><strong>Research and First Outcome</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph-5">It was a start-up, and we didn’t have enough budget to conduct primary research like user interviews. Instead, I studied available cases of other companies with similar products, analyzed competitors and looked at decisions of different designers on Dribbble. I also created references board with cool ideas. <strong>I think it is a really good approach to gather initial information if a company has a limited budget.<br>‍<br>‍</strong>So, after this, I provide calls with stakeholders, and together we defined the main points (based on the gathered information from my research) that needed to be implemented in the new update. We determined what the product is, who the target audience is, and what problems the product solves. We summarized this in one phrase:<br></p>
        <div class="w-layout-vflex b2b-block">
          <h3 class="heading-6">“B2B Fintech solution <br>for managing crypto and fiat assets”</h3>

            <p class="sub-par"><strong>How: </strong>Manage crypto and fiat assets</p>
            <p class="small-par">p.s. Yes, all of these points (what, for who, how) we also described more deeper in our documentation</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph-5">All of these helped us (me, team, stakeholders) to define the product we were working on and more clear to understand the main direction. Only then, I started to work with wireframes.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph-5">I updated wireframes and they become correspond to reality. You can see it in screens bellow. I tried to consider team and stakeholders demands while design this.<br><br>Step by step, I created new functional screens, considering the abilities of our engineers.

      <div class="w-layout-hflex flex-block-16">
        <p class="paragraph-5">The main idea of this case is that thorough preparation at the beginning can significantly impact both the process and outcomes. Conducting research before starting helps in better understanding the project, gathering valuable information that can benefit the entire company, and ultimately achieving better results that justify the investment in design.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-5"><strong>Summary:<br></strong>- Study available cases with similar products.<br>- Read relevant articles.Look at other designers&#x27; works.<br>- Analyze competitors.<br>- Clearly define the product you&#x27;re working on.<br>- Start creating wireframes and layouts.</p>
