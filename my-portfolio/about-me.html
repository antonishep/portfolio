      <p class="paragraph-5 _8">Hi, my name is Anthony. I am a UI/UX designer, web developer and have a background in marketing.<br><br>I&#x27;m 27 years old, I&#x27;m from Ukraine, I have more than 2 years of experience in UI/UX design, more than 3 years in marketing and recently I know how to work with HTML &amp; CSS. It is very important for me not to stand still, but to constantly act and develop. I can speak English, but it is easier for me to express my thoughts in text form.<br><br>I follow design trends and use AI for my work. I also follow the news from web 3.0 and understand the terminology: blockchain, crypto, nft, exchange, dex, cex, custodial, non-custodial, defi, on-chain swap, kyc, 2fa, ico and something else.<br><br>Marketing. More than 3 years.I have an education as an economist and marketer, and in general, I started my career with marketing in social networks, where I learned to work with graphic editors and to be a multitasker. I learned a lot of cool things, including how to influence people and convey the necessary thoughts to them. I also learned to work with social networks and understand their features. This knowledge became very useful for me and I still use it. I worked in an advertising agency, and also engaged in individual projects: e-commerce, ho-re-ca, online school, etc.<br><br>UI/UX design. More than 2 years.I started designing when the war started in my country, and all my marketing projects were closed (and that&#x27;s why I was left without a job in one day, such Ukrainian realities).<br><br>When I decided to switch to design, it became a discovery for me that a lot of things from marketing are also used for ui/ux design, for example: the ability to work with graphic editors, to be focused, multitasking, the ability to find solutions, analyze data and user behavior. And so, I relatively easily switched from a marketer to a ui/ux-designer and after a month I joined a team that was developing fintech software in Â web 3.<br><br>We created many different projects, but there is one, marionette.dev (look on Figma), the most important one that we worked on for about a year. This is a web application for any manipulation of financial assets (fiat and crypto). While working on this project, I learned a lot about blockchain technology and improved my Figma skills. Especially super important, I learned to pay attention to details and structure the layout to be convenient for developers or PM or QA.<br><br>Currently, we have a good relationship with this team and I sometimes help them a bit. The rest of the time I either do freelance projects, or study, or play basketball, for example :)<br><br>Web development. HTML &amp; CSS. A few months.<br>I&#x27;ll be honest. I put off learning HTML &amp; CSS until the end, because I thought it was quite a difficult topic. And when I did dare, I discovered that it was not so difficult and quite interesting. So now I have studied the base and understand how to work with it. Yes, I still have a lot to learn, but in general I already understand HTML and CSS and I can already find solutions on my own.<br><br>In general, this topic has become interesting for me and I want to develop in it, so every day I learn some new features. And who knows what will happen in a month or two or more :)<br><br>Conclusion <br>So what can I say about myself? I am a dedicated designer / web developer with a marketing background. I don&#x27;t know a lot, but I&#x27;m a quick learner and I&#x27;m interested in developing in this direction.<br><br>Thanks for your attention and have a good day.<br>In touch!</p>
