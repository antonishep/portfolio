I am proud that I contributed to get this project off the ground, and next I will describe how.<br><br>When I joineded the team the main problem was, the company already had the technology and planned to upgrade and develop it furthermore, but no one knew how to start, <strong>a</strong><strong>nd this was the main problem.</strong> I only got low-fidelity wireframes of a possible product without a clear vision of what it should be.<br><br>‍<strong>It was a real challenge</strong> for me to start. I had no experience in fintech before and didn&#x27;t know much about blockchain. However, I used my other skills to gather all the necessary information to get started.</p>

        <div class="w-layout-hflex flex-block-16">
          <p class="sub-title"><strong>How it started</strong></p>
          <p class="paragraph-5">It was my first project in a UX designer role. Before this, I worked and developed in the digital marketing field, but when war came to my country (24 Feb 2022), I lost all my projects.<br><br>So, I decided to move into design because I had considered this before and also already had some related skills from marketing, such as graphic design, ux-foundations, audience interaction, data analysis etc.</p>

          <p class="sub-title"><strong>The problem</strong></p>
          <p class="paragraph-5">Initially, stakeholders provided a brief overview of the project, and I was eager to start. Unfortunately, this eagerness led me to begin updating the existing low-fidelity wireframes without fully understanding the project scope. This approach proved to be a mistake, as I soon found myself inundated with numerous edits that did little to help me progress. It seemed I was stuck at the beginning.<br>‍<br>Realizing the need for a better foundation, I decided to conduct thorough research. I gathered input information, which improved my understanding of the project and the relevant field.</p>

          <p class="sub-title"><strong>Research and First Outcome</strong></p>
          <p class="paragraph-5">It was a start-up, and we didn’t have enough budget to conduct primary research like user interviews. Instead, I studied available cases of other companies with similar products, analyzed competitors and looked at decisions of different designers on Dribbble. I also created references board with cool ideas. <strong>I think it is a really good approach to gather initial information if a company has a limited budget.<br>‍<br>‍</strong>So, after this, I provide calls with stakeholders, and together we defined the main points (based on the gathered information from my research) that needed to be implemented in the new update. We determined what the product is, who the target audience is, and what problems the product solves. We summarized this in one phrase:<br></p>

          <p class="paragraph-5">All of these helped us (me, team, stakeholders) to define the product we were working on and more clear to understand the main direction. Only then, I started to work with wireframes.<br></p>
